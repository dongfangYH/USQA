```

Example 2:

Original (Problem-oriented Violation: Hard-coded implementation and duration):

```

Example 4:

Original (Problem-oriented Violation: Prescribes notification mechanisms and threshold):

Rewrite (Problem-oriented compliant):
```
As a warehouse worker, I want to know when stock levels are low, so that I can request replenishment in time.

Acceptance Criteria:

Given stock levels are being monitored
When any item falls below 10 units
Then the warehouse worker is notified
And notifications are sent via available channels (e.g., email, push)
