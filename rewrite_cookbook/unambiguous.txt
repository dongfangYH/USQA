Unambiguous Violation Rewrite Examples:

Example 1:

Original (Unambiguous Violation: Subjective terms):
```
As an operator, I want the page header hidden so the interface stays "optimized", maximizing usable space for tasks.

Acceptance Criteria:

Given the operator is on the dashboard
When the header is toggled off
Then the interface appears optimized without layout problems
```

Rewrite (Unambiguous compliant):
```
As an operator, I want the page header hidden so that I have more workspace for dashboard tasks.

Acceptance Criteria:

Given the operator is on the dashboard
When the header is toggled off
Then the visible workspace increases by at least 15% without overlapping or truncating widgets
```

Example 2:

Original (Unambiguous Violation: Vague quantifiers and undefined behavior):

```
As a product owner, I want to add some kind of notice to AI-generated content, so that viewers treat results with care.

Given AI content is displayed
When content is produced
Then show a notice of some kind
```

Rewrite (Unambiguous compliant):

```
As a product owner, I want a standardized disclaimer attached to all AI-generated content, so that viewers understand the content is machine-produced and should be verified.

Acceptance Criteria:

Given AI content is displayed
When content is produced
Then a banner labeled "AI-generated: verify before use" appears above the content in bold text
```
