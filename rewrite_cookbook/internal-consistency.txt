Internal Consistency Violation Rewrite Examples:

Example 1:

Original (Internal Consistency Violation: Role–Action mismatch):
```
As a customer, I want to enable database replication, so that the cluster maintains high availability.

Acceptance Criteria:

Given a database cluster exists
When the customer attempts to enable replication
Then replication is enabled
```

Rewrite (Internal consistency compliant):
```
As a database administrator, I want to enable database replication, so that the cluster maintains high availability.

Acceptance Criteria:

Given a database cluster exists
When the administrator enables replication
Then the cluster maintains high availability
```

Example 2:

Original (Internal Consistency Violation: Role–Action mismatch / system task):
```
As a support agent, I want to run nightly maintenance scripts, so that the system archive is compacted.

Acceptance Criteria:

Given nightly maintenance is scheduled
When the agent runs maintenance scripts
Then the system archive is compacted
```

Rewrite (Internal consistency compliant):
```
As a system administrator, I want to schedule nightly maintenance scripts, so that the system archive is compacted.

Acceptance Criteria:

Given nightly maintenance is configured
When the system executes maintenance scripts
Then the system archive is compacted
```

Example 3:

Original (Internal Consistency Violation: Intention phrasing ambiguous / human cannot "support" a framework):
```
As a tester, I want to support the new validation framework, so that tests pass across environments.

Acceptance Criteria:

Given the validation framework is deployed
When the tester executes tests
Then tests pass across environments
```

Rewrite (Internal consistency compliant):
```
As a tester, I want to execute tests using the new validation framework, so that tests pass across environments.

Acceptance Criteria:

Given the validation framework is deployed
When the tester runs test cases
Then test results are validated across all environments
```

Example 4:

Original (Internal Consistency Violation: Benefit subject mismatch):
```
As a clerk, I want to approve vendor invoices, so that we can reduce accounting workload.

Acceptance Criteria:

Given invoices are submitted
When the clerk approves an invoice
Then the accounting workload is reduced
```

Rewrite (Internal consistency compliant):
```
As a clerk, I want to approve vendor invoices, so that I can manage my accounting tasks efficiently.

Acceptance Criteria:

Given invoices are submitted
When the clerk approves an invoice
Then the clerk’s accounting tasks are managed efficiently
```

Example 5:

Original (Internal Consistency Violation: Action–Benefit contradiction):
```
As a user, I want to disable notifications, so that I still receive critical alerts.

Acceptance Criteria:

Given notification settings exist
When the user disables notifications
Then critical alerts are still received
```

Rewrite (Internal consistency compliant):
```
As a user, I want to disable non-critical notifications, so that I still receive critical alerts.

Acceptance Criteria:

Given notification settings exist
When the user disables non-critical notifications
Then critical alerts continue to be delivered
```
