
### Simple

A user story is considered **simple** when its description and intention are concise and unambiguous. Specifically:

1. **Single Intention:**

   * The `<Intention>` field represents **only one goal or action**.
   * It must not combine multiple intentions in a single statement.

2. **No Supplementary Information:**

   * The `<Intention>` and `<Benefit>` fields must **not include extra descriptive text**, explanations, or unrelated details.
   * Each field should clearly express its core meaning without additional context or commentary.
