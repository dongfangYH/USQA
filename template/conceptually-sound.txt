### Conceptually Sound

A user story is **conceptually sound** when each of its six key elements is used in accordance with its intended meaning. Specifically:

	* <R> (Role): represents the actor or user type who interacts with the system.
	* <I> (Intention): represents the goal or action the role wants to achieve.
	* <B> (Benefit): represents the value or rationale for why the role seeks this intention.
	* <C> (Context): represents the preconditions or system state under which the event takes place.
	* <E> (Event): represents the specific action or trigger that initiates system behavior.
	* <EO> (Expected Outcome): represents the observable result or system response to the event.

A conceptually sound user story ensures that each field is not only present but also aligns with its semantic purpose.
