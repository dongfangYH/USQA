### Problem-oriented

A user story is considered **problem-oriented** when its description emphasizes the **user’s need or problem** rather than implementation details. Specifically:

1. **No Implementation Details:**

   * The `<Intention>` and `<Benefit>` fields must describe **what the user wants to achieve** and **why**, without specifying how the system will implement it.

2. **Focus on the Problem:**

   * The story should highlight the **user’s goal, pain point, or requirement**, keeping the narrative solution-independent.

A problem-oriented user story ensures clarity of the **user need**, making it easier for the development team to explore multiple implementation options.
