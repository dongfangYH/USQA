### Internal Consistency

A user story is **internal-consistency** when its **description** is logically aligned and free of contradictions.

## Examples

As a customer, I want to save items to a wishlist, so that I can purchase them later.
// Non-violation: Role (customer), Intention (save items), and Benefit (purchase later) are aligned and refer to the same actor.

As an administrator, I want to assign user roles, so that employees receive appropriate access rights.
// Non-violation: Administrator performs the action and receives the corresponding benefit; no actor mismatch.

As a nurse, I want to view a patient’s medication history, so that I can administer the correct dose.
// Non-violation: Nurse is the actor, the intention is clear, and the benefit pertains to the nurse’s work—logically consistent.

As a warehouse clerk, I want to mark orders as packed, so that shipping can proceed on schedule.
// Non-violation: The clerk’s action produces the stated benefit; actor, action, and benefit are coherent.

As a data analyst, I want access to raw export files, so that I can validate reported metrics.
// Non-violation: The role requests a capability and the benefit explains how that role gains value—consistent.

As a customer, I want to enable database replication, so that the cluster maintains high availability.
// Violation: A customer cannot *enable* a database-level capability; the Intention assigns an action that logically belongs to system administrators, causing role–action mismatch.

As a support agent, I want to run nightly maintenance scripts, so that the system archive is compacted.
// Violation: The Intention implies the agent performs technical system tasks (running scripts), while the Benefit is described as a system behavior—responsibilities and subjects are misaligned.

As a tester, I want to support the new validation framework, so that tests pass across environments.
// Violation: The verb "support" targets a feature or system capability; a human role cannot logically *support* a framework in the same conceptual sense, so the Intention is phrased incorrectly.

As a clerk, I want to approve vendor invoices, so that we can reduce accounting workload.
// Violation: The Benefit uses "we" (an ambiguous collective) while the Role is an individual clerk; the stated benefit’s subject and the Role are misaligned and may imply responsibilities beyond the clerk’s scope.

As a user, I want to disable notifications, so that I still receive critical alerts.
// Violation:  The Intention (disable notifications) directly contradicts the Benefit (still receive alerts), producing an internal contradiction between action and expected outcome.
