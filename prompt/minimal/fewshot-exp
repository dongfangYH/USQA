### Minimal

A user story is **minimal** when its description contains **only Role, Intention, and Benefit**, with **no extra information or supplementary details** beyond these three elements.

## Examples

As a user with profile permission, I want to assign a profile to users, So that I can control their access.
Non-violation — The story description strictly contains Role (*user with profile permission*), Intention (*assign a profile to users*), and Benefit (*control their access*). No extra or supplementary details.

As a developer, I want an API to retrieve Site configuration, So that I can get `site name` and `site id` information.
Non-violation* — Although `site name` and `site id` are mentioned, they are **integral to the stated benefit** and not an additional explanation. The description still fits Role, Intention, Benefit only.

As an admin, I want to filter out users that have been marked as inactive, So that I can get to know the inactive users.
Non-violation* — Clean separation of Role, Intention, and Benefit. No extra explanatory details outside the three core fields.

As a worker, I want the system to display Work Instruction (WI), So that I can review the WI in case I forget it.
Non-violation — The acronym (WI) is an acceptable shorthand, not supplementary information. The Intention and Benefit remain concise and minimal.

As a user, I want to login the system by scanning a QR code, So that I can access the system without typing my username and password.
Non-violation — The method (QR code) is part of the **Intention** itself, not a supplementary explanation. No extra narrative beyond Role, Intention, and Benefit.

As a user, I want to import users through uploading a file (csv, excel, json).
Violation — The file types (*csv, excel, json*) are supplementary technical details beyond the core Intention. This makes the story description non-minimal.

As a worker, I want the system to display Work Instruction, So that I can review the WI (in case I forget it).
Violation — The phrase "in case I forget it" is supplementary justification embedded inside the Benefit. This extra description violates minimality.

As a user, I want to view my profile, So that I can get to know my information recorded. Information should include name, email and address.**
Violation — The second sentence ("Information should include name, email and address") is an additional explanatory statement outside the Role-Intention-Benefit format.
