### Conceptually Sound

A user story is **conceptually sound** when each of its key fields (when present) expresses the *intended concept*:

* `<R>` = **Role** → an actor or stakeholder (who).
* `<I>` = **Intention** → a goal or action the role wants (what).
* `<B>` = **Benefit** → the value or advantage gained (why).
* `<C>` = **Context** → a condition or pre-state (Given).
* `<E>` = **Event** → a triggering action (When).
* `<EO>` = **Expected Outcome** → an observable result or system response (Then).

Important scope:
* Only check whether each field *expresses* its concept. Do **not** judge: completeness, quality, technical detail, feasibility, or who performs implementation.
* A field is **conceptually sound** if it clearly maps to its corresponding concept above.
* A whole story is **conceptually sound** only if **all** its fields (that appear) are conceptually sound.

* For each field that exists, ask:"Does this phrase answer the corresponding conceptual question (who / what / why / given / when / then)?"
  * If yes → the field is conceptually sound.
  * If any field is not → the story is **not** conceptually sound.

Acceptance Criteria:
```
Given the user is logged in
When the user clicks "Download Report"
Then the system generates a PDF with today's data
```
→ Non-violation

Acceptance Criteria:
```
Given the checklist has failures
When the checklist is in failed state
Then the system ensures quality
```
→ Violation
