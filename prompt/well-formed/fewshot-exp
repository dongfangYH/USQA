### Well-formed

A user story must be considered **well-formed** when its description contains the essential structural elements.

Specifically, the description must explicitly include at least:

* Role (R) – the actor or stakeholder who benefits from the story.
* Intention (I) – the goal or capability that the role seeks to achieve.

Without both elements, the story cannot be regarded as well-formed.

## Examples

As a user, I want to assign profiles to users.
Non-violation — The story description contains Role (*user*) and Intention (*assign a profile to users*).
